        <h1> tacocat: The FAQ!</h1>
        <p>
            <italics>How do you stylize your username?</italics>
            <br />tacocat. All lowercase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <italics>What are your pronouns?</italics>
            <br />she/her
        </p>
        <p>
            <italics>Is your username tacocat because you like tacos and cats?</italics>
            <br />While both of these are true, that's not why I use tacocat. Tacocat happens to be my favorite palindrome, and I enjoy wordplay.
        </p>
        <p>
            <italics>Are you looking for a job?</italics>
            <br />Yes. I am in the middle of a job search. It happens.

        <p>
            <italics>Why do you want to leave America?</italics>
            <br />Because of American politics. Specifically, the lax views of discrimination, healthcare, and gun safety in America.
        </p>
        <p>
            <italics>Ok, makes sense. But why Germany?</italics>
            <br />Because Germany has legal protections for classes I fall into, and stricter firearms laws. The much lower crime rates are also nice. Also, my industry is pretty prevalent and in dire need of knowledgable people.
        </p>
        <p>
            <italics>What do you do for a living?</italics>
            <br />I am a DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, with a focus on developer assistance and enablement. I've been in the tech industry for 11+ years.
